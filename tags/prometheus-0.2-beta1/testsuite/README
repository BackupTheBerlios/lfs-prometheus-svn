Prometheus Testsuite

Before running the testsuite, you must have already run `make install'.  If you
wish to avoid installation until after testing, you should adjust Makefile.defs
to install into a temporary prefix before running `make'.  Make sure that the
temporary bin and sbin directories are at the front of your $PATH so that the
testsuite can find the tools it wants to check.

To run the testsuite, invoke:

	make check

The testsuite will halt on the first failure and tell you which log file is
relevant for debugging the error.

If you installed prometheus into a temporary prefix for checking, you can
complete the final install by running

	make clean

and then adjusting Makefile.defs to reflect the final installation prefix.
Complete your installation by (again) running:

	make
	make install
