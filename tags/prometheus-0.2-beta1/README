Prometheus 0.2

ProMeTheuS is the Package Management Tool Set.

It is intended for use by the LFS audience.  It grew from a simple LFS build
script to a collection of tools that should cover most package management needs
of the average LFS user.

Prometheus uses install-log as backend and features very powerful package
profiles that can even be used to build a complete LFS by issueing a single
command.

Features:
* installation and removal of software packages
* keeps track of installed files using install-log
* keeps track of version information
* simple dependency resolution method
* powerful package profiles based on bash shell scripts
* simple package download facility
* flexible tool to query package profiles and get information
  on installed packages


First steps
-----------

To create a system that uses Prometheus from the beginning, follow these
instructions:

Install Prometheus as explained in the INSTALL file:

	make user
	make
	make install
	cp prometheus-0.2-beta1.tar.bz2 ~prometheus/sources

If you already have the sources for LFS 6.1, copy them to ~prometheus/sources.
Run

	pkginfo -a | cut -f1 -d' ' | xargs pkgget

to fetch any missing needed files.  To double-check, run the command again.
If the prompt just returns, you have all needed files and are ready to go.

Decide where you want your new LFS system (I suggest /mnt/lfs) and edit

	~prometheus/profiles/lfs

accordingly.  Look for the 'lfs=' and 'mount_lfs=' and 'lfs_device=' lines at
the top of the file.

You might also want to edit /etc/prometheus/prometheus.conf to change the
logging options, CFLAGS etc.  (Note that those won't apply once the chroot
environment of LFS chapter six is entered).

Now, just simply type

	pkgadd lfs

sit back, and watch.  A complete build takes about four hours on my Athlon XP
1700.


In your new system, you surely want to add more packages.  Take a look at
~prometheus/profiles/REFERENCE.pkg to see how a profile is written.
