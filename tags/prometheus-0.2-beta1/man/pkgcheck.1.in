.SH NAME

pkgcheck \- Run package testsuites.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "pkgcheck [ " options " ] " package_list

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B pkgcheck
runs package testsuites to ensure that packages are built correctly.  Packages
are checked in the order given on the commandline.  The built packages are
expected to be in the build directory.
.BR pkgbuild (1)
should be invoked to build the packages before running
.BR "pkgcheck".

Packages are specified by short name (without a version number), e.g. `bash',
`gcc'.  Profiles have the same name suffixed by
.I .pkg
(`bash.pkg', `gcc.pkg'), and are searched for first in the current working
directory, then in the profile directory.

After running
.BR "pkgcheck",
.BR pkginstall (8)
may be invoked to complete package installation.

.SH OPTIONS

All options must precede
.IR "package_list".
When options conflict or are repeated, the last on the commandline is used.
