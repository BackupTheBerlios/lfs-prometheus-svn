.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "pkgbuild [ " options " ] " package_list

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B pkgbuild
builds packages from their source code, in the order given on the commandline.
The source code is expected to be in the build directory.
.BR pkgunpack (1)
should be invoked to prepare the source code before running
.BR "pkgbuild".

Packages are specified by short name (without a version number), e.g. `bash',
`gcc'.  Profiles have the same name and are located in the
.I profiles
directory in the prometheus user's home directory.

After running
.BR "pkgbuild",
.BR pkginstall (8)
may be invoked to complete package installation, or
.BR pkgcheck (1)
may first be used to run the packages' testsuites.
