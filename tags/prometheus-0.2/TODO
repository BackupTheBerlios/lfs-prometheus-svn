* `make clean' currently doesn't sanitize the modified profiles (%PKGADD% in
  the LFS build scripts etc.)

* The LFS build script doesn't take off from where it left after it got inter-
  rupted, but has to restart from the beginning. Re-add the stageX_pkg
  files. Use these files for stages 0 and 1, pkginfo for stage 2, maybe?

* While reroot is not yet ready for use, maybe make use of install-log's
  "# Old #" and "# Del #" comments? Make install-log not write to a temp
  file, sed out the comments before re-installing a package (lest they get
  lost), etc.
