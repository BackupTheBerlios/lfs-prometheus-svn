Bugs:

* libpng, zip, unzip, openssl, pciutils, libwrap do not use CFLAGS etc.

* fcron profile does not allow re-install (check for existing users etc.)

* Starting `pkgadd lfs' in a directory which the `lfs' user may not enter
  breaks the build ("popd: Permission denied").

* $lfs/{proc,dev} and $lfs_srcdir don't get unmounted on errors during build

* If lfs_srcdir is `mount --bind'ed, the profile changes permissions on the
  host system. Try to avoid that some way.
