Prometheus 0.1

ProMeTheuS is the Package Managing Tool Set.

It is intended for use by the LFS audience. It grew from a simple
LFS build script to a collection of tools that should cover most
package management needs of the average LFS user.

Prometheus uses install-log as backend and features very powerful
package profiles that can even be used to build a complete LFS by
issueing a single command.

Features:
* installation and removal of software packages
* keeps track of installed files using install-log
* keeps track of version information
* simple dependency resolution method
* powerful package profiles based on bash shell scripts
* simple package download facility
* flexible tool to query package profiles and get information
  on installed packages
