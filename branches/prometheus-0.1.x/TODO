Still to do:

* Implement dependency checking between packages (well, once we've got this
  covered we can use the same functions for dcis and prometheus ;-)
  Note: this is almost done, as it seems. Yet untested though.
  We can't use this for dcis, though, as we have to use a different approach
  there. Maybe we can re-use some parts.

* Have pkgrm check for breaking dependencies if a package is removed.

* If an *install* fails, still run install-log to find out what *was* installed,
  so it can be cleanly removed.  Give user a choice to clean up after a failed
  install.

* Better checking for script options (is it a file or a package etc.)
  Note: This is quite a nightmare and its use darn incosistent throughout
  the whole pkgtools suite. Some scripts support it, some not, some functions
  support it, some not. It's a mess :-/
  Note: The situation has somewhat improved. I think. Certainly.

* Option to cross-compile according to the cross-compilation hint
  (ie. using a kernel module).

* `lfs-install' script may return as a wrapper for `pkgget (all packages)',
  optional pkgcompress, and finally `pkgadd lfs'.  Maybe a final run of Gerard's
  `check-lfs' to give people a warm fuzzy feeling.

* Profiles!
  I'd consider this done, at least for a base LFS build. See the other TODOs
  for some minor tweaking, though.
