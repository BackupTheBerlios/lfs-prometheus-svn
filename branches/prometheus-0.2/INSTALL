Installation of prometheus is straightforward.

Do NOT just copy the files to where you want them!  The scripts as well as some
package profiles need pre-processing.  Also, as of version 0.2 Prometheus uses
a user and group 'prometheus' and cannot work without it.  To create them, type

	make user

Then take a look at Makefile.defs and adjust it to your liking.  Then type

	make

followed by

	make install

(as root), and you're golden.  The Makefile honours the usual path definitions,
such as DESTDIR, prefix, bindir and so on.  Have a look at Makefile.defs for a
complete list.  You need to pass these path definitions to _both_ make calls.

You /might/ want to reinstall prometheus right afterwards with

	pkgadd prometheus

to register prometheus with its own databases and log files.

There is also an 'update' target that does not touch the config and profile
files in /etc/prometheus/ and ~prometheus.
