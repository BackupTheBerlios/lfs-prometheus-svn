User-visible changes between Prometheus 0.1 and 0.2:

- Prometheus now requires a dedicated user and group, both called prometheus.
  The home directory of said user is used to store all of Prometheus' data.
  This includes:
	- the package profiles
	- the log files and profiles of installed packages
	- all the source files
	- the temporary build directories

  You can add a normal, trusted, user to the promtheus group, who is then
  allowed to download source files for packges and edit and add package
  profiles.


- Prometheus can also run the compilation process as user prometheus.  This
  only works if pkgadd has been started by root. The details:

	    pkgadd	|	compilation	 |	installation
	  started by	|	 runs as	 |	  runs as
	--------------------------------------------------------------
	     $user	|	   $user	 |	   root
	     root	|	prometheus	 |	   root

  Note that if pkgadd has been started by an ordinary user, that user must
  be part of the promtheus group, otherwise the build will fail due to
  missing privileges.


- The format of the profiles has changed slightly.
  - It is now not necessary anymore to use bash's "and lists" ('&&').

  - Another change concerns the listing of dependencies in profiles.  In 0.1,
  a string variable called `dep' was used which contained a space-separated
  list of packages.  In 0.2, this is a bash array called `deps'.

  - There is also a new function available for use in profiles called
  `post_remove_pkg', which is run after a package has been removed.  This
  can be used to remove users or groups used by a package, for example.
