The `log_echo' test names follow the scheme `t<x>l<y>_<test>'.

The `t<x>' component is determined by the value of the $terminal_output
variable.  <x> is `y' or `n' for $terminal_output `yes' & `no' respectively.

The `l<y>' component is determined by the value of the $logfile variable. <y> is
`y' or `n' for $logfile set to a file or unset respectively.

<test> indicates what is actually being tested given the above parameters, one
of `log' (contents of log file), `stdout' (text echoed to stdout), or `stderr'
(text echoed to stderr).

`logfile.txt' contains expected `log_echo' output.
