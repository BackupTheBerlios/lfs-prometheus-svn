.TH PKGINSTALL 1 %RELEASE% "" "Linux User's Manual"

.SH NAME

pkginstall \- Install packages from their build directories.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "pkginstall [ " options " ] " package_list

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B pkginstall
installs packages from their build directories, in the order given on the
commandline.  The built packages are expected to be in the build directory.

Packages are specified by short name (without a version number), e.g. `bash',
`gcc'.  Profiles have the same name suffixed by
.I .pkg
(`bash.pkg', `gcc.pkg'), and are searched for first in the current working
directory, then in the profile directory.

.BR pkgbuild (1)
should be invoked to build the packages before running
.BR "pkginstall".
You may wish to invoke
.BR pkgcheck (1)
to run the packages' testsuites before installation too.

.SH OPTIONS

.IR "package_list".
When options conflict or are repeated, the last on the commandline is used.

The following options control what

does if installation of a package fails.  In this situation, depending on how
far installation progressed before failing, some files may have been copied to
the system.  These files constitute an incomplete installation that may conflict
with future installations of the package.  If such a situation arises and none
of these options are specified,
.B pkginstall
will ask the user what to do.
.BR pkgrm (8)
is used if a failed installation is removed.
