.TH PKGINSTALL 1 %RELEASE% "" "Linux User's Manual"

.SH NAME

pkginstall \- Install packages from their build directories.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "pkginstall [ " options " ] " package_list

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B pkginstall
installs packages from their build directories, in the order given on the
commandline.  The built packages are expected to be in the build directory
specified in
.IR "%CONFIG%".
.BR pkgbuild (1)
should be invoked to build the packages before running
.BR "pkginstall".
You may wish to invoke
.BR pkgcheck (1)
to run the packages' testsuites before installation too.

.SH PACKAGE LIST

Package profiles may be specified in two ways.  Any combination of the following
options may be used.

.BR -f ", " --profile
.I profile
.BR ...
.RS
Specify files containing package profiles.
.RE

.BR -p ", " --package
.I package
.BR ...
.RS
Specify packages by name.  Profiles will be searched for the profile directory
specified in
.IR "%CONFIG%".
This is the default behaviour if neither option is used.
.RE

.BR --
.RS
Treat remaining arguments as packages or profiles, even if they begin with `-'.
This effectively locks the package list into its current mode.

The following options control what

The following options control what
.B pkginstall
does if installation of a package fails.  In this situation, depending on how
far installation progressed before failing, some files may have been copied to
the system.  These files constitute an incomplete installation that may conflict
with future installations of the package.  If such a situation arises and none
of these options are specified,
.B pkginstall
will ask the user what to do.
.BR pkgrm (8)
is used if a failed installation is removed.

If multiple options are specified, the last one on the commandline is used.

.BR -L ", " --leave-failed
.RS
The failed installation is left.  It may be removed with
.BR pkgrm (8)
later.
.RE

.BR -R ", " --remove-failed
.RS
The failed installation is removed, leaving the system in the state it was in
before the installation was attempted.
