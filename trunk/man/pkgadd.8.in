.TH PKGADD 1 %RELEASE% "" "Linux User's Manual"

.SH NAME

pkgadd \- Download, build, check and install packages.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "pkgadd [ " options " ] " package_list

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B pkgadd
builds packages from source code and installs them, optionally downloading them
and checking their builds as well.  Packages' dependencies are also installed,
and installation is reordered so that dependencies are installed first.
Packages may be repeated on the commandline and in package dependencies, each
will only be installed once.

Packages are specified by short name (without a version number), e.g. `bash',
`gcc'.  Profiles have the same name suffixed by
.I .pkg
(`bash.pkg', `gcc.pkg'), and are searched for first in the current working
directory, then in the profile directory.

.SH OPTIONS

.IR "package_list".

The following options control what

does if installation of a package fails.  In this situation, depending on how
far installation progressed before failing, some files may have been copied to
the system.  These files constitute an incomplete installation that may conflict
with future installations of the package.  If such a situation arises and none
of these options are specified,
.B pkgadd
will ask the user what to do.
.BR pkgrm (8)
is used if a failed installation is removed.

before the installation was attempted.  If a previous installation was backed-up
and removed prior to the failed installation, its files will be restored.
