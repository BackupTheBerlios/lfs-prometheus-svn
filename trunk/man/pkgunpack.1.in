.TH PKGUNPACK 1 %RELEASE% "" "Linux User's Manual"

.SH NAME

pkgunpack \- Extract and patch source code from archives.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "pkgunpack [ " options " ] " package_list

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B pkgunpack
extracts the source code needed to build packages.  For each package, it
extracts files from the package's source archives and applies required patches.
Archives and patches are searched for in (subdirectories of) the source
directory, and source code is unarchived in the build directory.

Packages are specified by short name (without a version number), e.g. `bash',
`gcc'.  Profiles have the same name suffixed by
.I .pkg
(`bash.pkg', `gcc.pkg'), and are searched for first in the current working
directory, then in the profile directory.

After running
.BR "pkgunpack",
.BR pkgbuild (1)
may be invoked to build the source code.
