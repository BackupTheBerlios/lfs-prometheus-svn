.TH COMPACT 1 %RELEASE% "" "Linux User's Manual"

.SH NAME

compact \- Compress files with gzip and bzip2, keep the smallest.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "compact [ " options " ] { " file " | " directory " } ... "

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B compact
compresses
.I files
with both
.BR gzip (1)
and
.BR bzip2 (1).
For each file, the sizes of the two compressed and the original files are
compared and the smallest kept.  If two files are the same size, the
uncompressed file is kept in preference, followed by the gzipped.  Files that
are already compressed may be uncompressed.

Archives with filename suffixes
.I .tgz
and
.I .tbz*
will be renamed to have the suffixes
.I .tar.gz
and
.I .tar.bz2
respectively.
