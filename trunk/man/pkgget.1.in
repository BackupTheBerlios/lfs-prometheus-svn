.TH PKGGET 1 %RELEASE% "" "Linux User's Manual"

.SH NAME

pkgget \- Download files required to build and install packages.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "pkgget [ " options " ] " package_list

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B pkgget
checks that the archives and/or patches required to build and install each
package are present on the system, and downloads any that are not.  Files are
searched for in (subdirectories of) the source directory.  This is also where
files are downloaded to.  If a file is missing and the package profile lacks a
URL for the file, the user is warned and
.B pkgget
continues with the next file.

Download ordering is optimized so that connections to servers may be reused for
multiple files.
.BR wget (1)
is used for downloading.

Compression suffixes (e.g.
.IR ".gz" )
are ignored, so if, for example, a
.BR "gzip"ped
file was recompressed with
.B bzip2
after downloading, pkgget will not try to download it again.

Packages are specified by short name (without a version number), e.g. `bash',
`gcc'.  Profiles have the same name suffixed by
.I .pkg
(`bash.pkg', `gcc.pkg'), and are searched for first in the current working
directory, then in the profile directory.

.SH OPTIONS

All options must precede
.IR "package_list".
When options conflict or are repeated, the last on the commandline is used.
