.TH PKGGET 1 %RELEASE% "" "Linux User's Manual"

.SH NAME

pkgget \- Download files required to build and install packages.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "pkgget [ " options " ] " package_list

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B pkgget
checks that the archives and/or patches required to build and install each
package are present on the system, and downloads any that are not.  Files are
searched for in the source and build directories specified in
.IR "%CONFIG%".
If a file is missing and the package profile lacks a URL for the file, the user
is warned and
.B pkgget
continues with the next file.

Files are downloaded to the current directory.  If this is not the source
directory specified in
.I "%CONFIG%"
then the files should be moved there afterwards.  Download ordering is optimized
so that connections to servers may be used for multiple files.
.BR wget (1)
is used for downloading.

Compression suffixes (e.g.
.IR ".gz" )
are ignored, so if, for example, a
.BR "gzip"ped
file was recompressed with
.B bzip2
after downloading, pkgget will not try to download it again.

.SH PACKAGE LIST

Package profiles may be specified in two ways.  Any combination of the following
options may be used.

.BR -f ", " --profile
.I profile
.BR ...
.RS
Specify files containing package profiles.
.RE

.BR -p ", " --package
.I package
.BR ...
.RS
Specify packages by name.  Profiles will be searched for the profile directory
specified in
.IR "%CONFIG%".
This is the default behaviour if neither option is used.
.RE

.BR --
.RS
Treat remaining arguments as packages or profiles, even if they begin with `-'.
This effectively locks the package list into its current mode.
