.TH PKGRM 8 %RELEASE% "" "System Administration Manual"

.SH NAME

pkgrm \- Remove installed packages from the system.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "pkgrm [ " options " ] " package_list

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B pkgrm
removes installed packages from the system, in the order given on the command
line.  If so desired, it also creates a backup of the removed package.

.B pkgrm
uses the
.BR rerootd "(1) index files to determine which files have to be deleted."
It also creates a list of used directories and deletes them if they have
become empty.

Note that only files created at install time can be deleted.  Files that have
been created subsequently will be left behind and have to be removed manually.

By default,
.B pkgrm
asks the user for confirmation prior to removing a package.  It also queries for
a backup.  If other installed packages depend on the one to remove, another
confirmation is required.  These prompts can be skipped using the
.I --force
parameter.

Also by default,
.B pkgrm
will not remove files installed in
.IR /etc " or " /var ", unless the " --purge " flag is specified."

.SH OPTIONS

All options must precede
.IR package_list .
When options conflict or are repeated, the last on the command line is used.

.BR -c ", " --config
.I config_file
.RS
Specify alternative configuration file.
.RE

.BR -f ", " --force
.RS
Non-interactive mode.  The user will not be prompted for confirmation on
anything.  Packages that other installed packages depend on will be removed
nonetheless.  NO BACKUP IS PERFORMED UNLESS THE
.I --backup
OPTION IS USED AS WELL.
.RE

.BR -b ", " --backup
.RS
Create a backup of the package before removing it.  The backup will be created
.RI "in " ~prometheus/backup " and contain all those files that will be"
removed. This means the contents of the backup will change depending upon
.RI "whether the " --purge " flag (see below) was specified or not.  Any"
previous backups will be overwritten.  The backup will be a
.BR bzip2 "(1)-compressed tarball named after the short name of the package."
The backup follows the same format as a binary package tarball, so it can be
.RB "restored using " pkgadd (8).
.RE

.BR -p ", " --purge
.RS
Force removal of configuration files and variable data.  Normally, without this
.RB "option, " pkgrm " leaves files installed in
.IR /etc " and " /var " alone.  See the BUGS section, however, on why this
still might not remove all files.
.RE

.BR -s ", " --sources
.RS
Remove source files (tarballs and patches) that are not referenced from any
package profiles and are thus not needed anymore. For any of these files, the
user will be prompted whether to remove or to keep it.
.RE

.BR -h ", " -? ", " --help
.RS
Display the help screen.
.RE

.BR -V ", " --version
.RS
Display version information.
.RE

.B --
.RS
Treat all remaining arguments as packages.
.RE

.SH FILES

.I "%CONFDIR%/%CONFIG%"
.RS
The global prometheus configuration file.
.RE

.I "~prometheus/installed/profiles/*
.br
.I "~prometheus/installed/indices/*
.RS
Prometheus' meta data about installed packages.
.RE

.SH BUGS

- Only files created at install time will be deleted (or backed up, for that
matter).  Any files created subsequently have to be removed manually.
