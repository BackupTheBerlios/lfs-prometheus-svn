.SH NAME

pkgrm \- Remove installed packages from the system.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "pkgrm [ " options " ] " package_list

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B pkgrm
removes installed packages from the system, in the order given on the command
line.  If so desired, it also creates a backup of the removed package.

.B pkgrm
uses the
.BR install-log "(1) log files to determine which files have to be deleted. 
It also creates a list of used directories and deletes them if they have
become empty.

By default,
.B pkgrm
asks the user for confirmation prior to removing a package.  It also queries for
a backup.  If other installed packages depend on the one to remove, another
confirmation is required.  These prompts can be skipped using the
.I --force
parameter.

.SH OPTIONS

All options must precede
.IR package_list .
When options conflict or are repeated, the last on the command line is used.

Non-interactive mode.  The user will not be prompted for confirmation on
anything.  Packages that other installed packages depend on will be removed
nonetheless.  NO BACKUP IS PERFORMED UNLESS THE
.I --backup
OPTION IS USED AS WELL.
.RE

.BR -b ", " --backup
.RS
Create a backup of the package before removing it.  The backup will be created
in the directory specified by the
.I backupdir
directive in
.BR prometheus.conf "(5).  Any previous backups will be overwritten.  The
backup will be a
.BR bzip2 "(1)-compressed tarball named after the short name of the package
and the string .pkg.tar.bz2 appended, e.g. `bash.pkg.tar.bz2'.
.RE

.RE

.SH BUGS

- Although a backup to a tarball will save the package proper,
.BR prometheus' " state information will be lost, ie. if you restore the"
backup,
.BR prometheus " will not know about the package's version.  The"
.BR install-log "(1) log file will not be restored, either."

- There is no way to restore a backup except to do it by hand.
