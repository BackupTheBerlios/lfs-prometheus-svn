Some ramblings about reroot follow.

File types:
	file/link
	directory
	symbolic link
	pipe
	socket
	block device
	character device

Metadata that must be tracked:
	real filename
	rerooted filename
	owner
	group
	permission bits including sticky, suid & sgid
	ACL info?
	Symbolic link destination
	Device major & minor number

Actions:
	open
	close
	read
	write
	create
	unlink
	read meta
	write meta

User/group faking:
	get effective/real user/group IDs
	set effective/real user/group IDs
	get login name
	looking up users/groups
	scanning user/group list
	get group list for user
	(adding user via libc is depricated)

TODO: Expand on actions etc to plan what reroot functions need to do.
