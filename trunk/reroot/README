Some ramblings about reroot follow.

Should use __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden/default"))) liberally.  Best wait
for GCC 4.0 so can apply it to classes.  Also see -fvisibility.

File types:
	file/link
	directory
	symbolic link
	pipe
	socket
	block device
	character device

Metadata that must be tracked:
	real filename
	rerooted filename
	inode/device numbers?
	owner
	group
	permission bits including sticky, suid & sgid
	ACL info?
	Symbolic link destination
	Device major & minor number
	Dates & times - use filesystem for this

Actions:
	open
	close
	read
	write
	mmap
	create
	create link
	unlink
	read metadata
	write metadata
	read directory
	clean up
	write index

User/group faking:
	get effective/real user/group IDs
	set effective/real user/group IDs
	get login name
	looking up users/groups
	scanning user/group list
	get group list for user
	(adding user via libc is depricated)

Open
	If only opened for reading, pass straight to glibc.  Hope we have (real)
	permissions to read file, because we cannot fake them.  Or could fake an
	empty file, but seems a bit pointless.

	If opened for writing, copy file to false root & open it.  Flag as
	unmodified.

Close
	If opened for writing, unlink false root copy if unmodified.

Read
	Read false root version as necessary - do we need to intercept this?
	Open has done the redirection for us...

Write
	Write false root versions as necessary, flag as modified.

Mmap
	Mark as modified etc.

Create
	Create in false root, flag modified.

Create Link
	Symbolic link created in false root but with pointed to filename
	unmodified, simulate rerooted destination as necessary.

	Hard link - simulate.  Commit to FS later.

Unlink
	Unlink false root version.  What about the original version in real root
	if it exists?  Hopefully installs won't ever delete installed files.
	Remember file is deleted.

Read Metadata
	Read false root metadata, or real if not in false root.

Write Metadata
	Remember changes, even for files not under false root.  Need to store
	changes in index?

Read Directory
	Overlay false root hierarchy onto root.  This is the fun part.  Yay for
	efficiency etc.  Read false root directory first, then real ommitting
	duplicates.

Clean Up
	Remove files in false root marked unmodified or ignored (e.g.
	/etc/passwed).  Commit hard links to false root filesystem.
	Diff modified files, remove those that haven't actually changed.
	Transfer filename database from real to rerooted filenames for tar.

Write Index
	Save file list for false root.  Also include metadata.  What about
	deleted files or unmodified files with modified metadata?
