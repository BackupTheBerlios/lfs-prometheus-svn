* Write and use libreroot/rerootd, which will use LD_PRELOAD to intercept glibc
  calls.  It will do something cross between fakeroot and union mounts in order
  to build installable binary tarballs.

* compressdoc based on compact.

* Option to cross-compile according to the cross-compilation hint (ie. using a
  kernel module).  Make x86stepping support 2.6 kernels.  Is this still the best
  way?

* `lfs-install' script may return as a wrapper for `pkgget (all packages)',
  optional pkgcompress, and finally `pkgadd lfs'.  Maybe a final run of Gerard's
  `check-lfs' to give people a warm fuzzy feeling.

* `make clean' currently doesn't sanitize the modified profiles (%PKGADD% in
  the LFS build scripts etc.)

* The LFS build script doesn't take off from where it left after it got inter-
  rupted, but has to restart from the beginning. Re-add the stageX_pkg
  files. Use these files for stages 0 and 1, pkginfo for stage 2, maybe?

* While reroot is not yet ready for use, maybe make use of install-log's
  "# Old #" and "# Del #" comments? Make install-log not write to a temp
  file, sed out the comments before re-installing a package (lest they get
  lost), etc.
