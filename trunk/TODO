* Write and use libreroot/rerootd, which will use LD_PRELOAD to intercept glibc
  calls.  It will do something cross between fakeroot and union mounts in order
  to build installable binary tarballs.

* compressdoc based on compact.

* Option to cross-compile according to the cross-compilation hint (ie. using a
  kernel module).  Make x86stepping support 2.6 kernels.  Is this still the best
  way?

* `lfs-install' script may return as a wrapper for `pkgget (all packages)',
  optional pkgcompress, and finally `pkgadd lfs'.  Maybe a final run of Gerard's
  `check-lfs' to give people a warm fuzzy feeling.

* we're not keeping track of installed patches. Try to find a solution.
