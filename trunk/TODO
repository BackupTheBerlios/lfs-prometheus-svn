* Build logging handled in pkgadd.  If file, run tail if error.  Remove `no' as
  option, better let user set log destination file.

* Restoring scripts from prometheus 0.1.

* x86stepping: Support 2.6 kernels.

* Implement dependency checking between packages.

* Have pkgrm check for breaking dependencies if a package is removed.

* If an *install* fails, still run install-log to find out what *was* installed,
  so it can be cleanly removed.  Give user a choice to clean up after a failed
  install.

* Use a lock file for pkginstall so that no two installs may run concurrently.
  This will prevent confusing install-log.

* Use $DESTDIR instead of install-log?  Emulate $DESTDIR with chroot for
  packages that don't support it?

* compressdoc based on compact.

* Option to cross-compile according to the cross-compilation hint
  (ie. using a kernel module).

* `lfs-install' script may return as a wrapper for `pkgget (all packages)',
  optional pkgcompress, and finally `pkgadd lfs'.  Maybe a final run of Gerard's
  `check-lfs' to give people a warm fuzzy feeling.

* Profiles.
