* x86stepping: Support 2.6 kernels.

* Use $DESTDIR instead of install-log?  Emulate $DESTDIR with chroot for
  packages that don't support it?  Or use LD_PRELOAD trickery? - fakeroot

* compressdoc based on compact.

* Option to cross-compile according to the cross-compilation hint
  (ie. using a kernel module).

* `lfs-install' script may return as a wrapper for `pkgget (all packages)',
  optional pkgcompress, and finally `pkgadd lfs'.  Maybe a final run of Gerard's
  `check-lfs' to give people a warm fuzzy feeling.

* Profiles.

* we're not keeping track of installed patches. Try to find a solution.
