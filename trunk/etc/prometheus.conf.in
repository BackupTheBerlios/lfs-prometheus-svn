# The following values may be overridden per package in package profiles.  All
# can be further overridden by additional variables with the same names but
# prefixed with `stage<n>_', where <n> is an integer.  For example, stage 1
# should not be built as root, so `install_as_root=yes' is overridden by
# `stage1_install_as_root=no'.

# If this is set to a filename, builds & installs (both stdout & stderr) are
# logged to the file.

# Should install-log be run?

# Should packages be *installed* as root?  (Build user not affected.)

# This variable is used to keep the source files unpacked even after installing
# packages.  Its use is analogous to the `--leave-files' switch to pkgadd.
